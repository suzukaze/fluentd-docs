# Amazon S3 Output Plugin

The `out_s3` Buffered Output plugin writes records into the Amazon S3 cloud object storage service. By default, it creates files on an hourly basis. This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no file is created immediately. The file will be created when the `time_slice_format` condition has been met. To change the output frequency, please modify the `time_slice_format` value.

## Installation

`out_s3` is included in td-agent by default. Fluentd gem users will need to install the fluent-plugin-s3 gem using the following command.

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-s3

## Example Configuration

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type s3

      aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID
      aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET/KEY
      s3_bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      s3_endpoint s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com
      path logs/
      buffer_path /var/log/fluent/s3

      time_slice_format %Y%m%d%H
      time_slice_wait 10m
      utc

      buffer_chunk_limit 256m
    </match>

Please see the [Store Apache Logs into Amazon S3](apache-to-s3) article for real-world use cases.

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

NOTE: Please make sure that you have <b>enough space in the buffer_path directory</b>. Running out of disk space is a probelm frequently reported by users.

## Parameters

### type (required)
The value must be `s3`.

### aws_key_id (required)
The AWS access key id.

### aws_sec_key (required)
The AWS secret key.

### s3_bucket (required)
The Amazon S3 bucket name.

### buffer_path (required)
The path prefix of the log buffer files.

### s3_endpoint
The Amazon S3 endpoint name. Please select the appropriate endpoint name from the list below and confirm that your bucket has been created in the correct region.

* s3.amazonaws.com
* s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com
* s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
* s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
* s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
* s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
* s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

The most recent versions of the endpoints can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).

### time_slice_format
The time format used as part of the file name. The following characters are replaced with actual values when the file is created:

* %Y: year including the century (at least 4 digits)
* %m: month of the year (01..12)
* %d: Day of the month (01..31)
* %H: Hour of the day, 24-hour clock (00..23)
* %M: Minute of the hour (00..59)
* %S: Second of the minute (00..60)

The default format is `%Y%m%d%H`, which creates one file per hour.

### time_slice_wait
The amount of time Fluentd will wait for old logs to arrive. This is used to account for delays in logs arriving to your Fluentd node. The default wait time is 10 minutes ('10m'), where Fluentd will wait until 10 minutes past the hour for any logs that occured within the past hour.

For example, when splitting files on an hourly basis, a log recorded at 1:59 but arriving at the Fluentd node between 2:00 and 2:10 will be uploaded together with all the other logs from 1:00 to 1:59 in one transaction, avoiding extra overhead. Larger values can be set as needed.

### time_format
The format of the time written in files. The default format is ISO-8601.

### path
The path prefix of the files on S3. The default is “” (no prefix).

NOTE: The actual path on S3 will be: “{path}{time_slice_format}_{sequential_number}.gz”

### utc
Uses UTC for path formatting. The default format is localtime.

### store_as
The compression type. The default is "gzip", but you can also choose "lzo", "json", or "txt".

### proxy_uri
The proxy url. The default is nil.

### use_ssl
Enable/disable SSL for data transfers between Fluentd and S3. The default is "yes".

## Buffer Parameters
For advanced usage, you can tune Fluentd's internal buffering mechanism with these parameters.

### buffer_type
The buffer type is `file` by default ([buf_file](buf_file)). The `memory` ([buf_memory](buf_memory)) buffer type can be chosen as well. The `path` parameter is used as `buffer_path` in this plugin.

### buffer_queue_limit, buffer_chunk_limit
The length of the chunk queue and the size of each chunk, respectively. Please see the [Buffer Plugin Overview](buffer-plugin-overview) article for the basic buffer structure. The default values are 256 and 256m, respectively. The suffixes “k” (KB), “m” (MB), and “g” (GB) can be used for buffer_chunk_limit.

### flush_interval
The interval between forced data flushes. The default is nil (don't force flush and wait until the end of time slice + time_slice_wait). The suffixes “s” (seconds), “m” (minutes), and “h” (hours) can be used.

### retry_wait and retry_limit
The interval between write retries, and the number of retries. The default values are 1.0 and 17, respectively. `retry_wait` doubles every retry (e.g. the last retry waits for 131072 sec, roughly 36 hours).

### num_threads
The number of threads to flush the buffer. This option can be used to parallelize the data upload into S3. The default is 1.
